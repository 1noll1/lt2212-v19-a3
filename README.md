# LT2212 V19 Assignment 3

From Asad Sayeed's statistical NLP course at the University of Gothenburg.

My name: Linnea Strand

## Additional instructions

I made 'testlines' a required argument, for simplicity. I just chose a random default value (10), but optimally it should be put to a % of the training data â€“ 10 % or so. 

## Reporting for Part 4

Note: In test.py, since smoothing would be terribly cumbersome, any unknown labels are assigned the lowest probability of the distribution returned by pred_log_proba.

Example commands:
gendata.py brown_rga.txt outputfile 250 -E1000
train.py outputfile_train model
test.py outputfile_test model.p

| Commands | Accuracy  | Perplexity |
| gendata.py brown_rga.txt outputfile 50 -E500 | ------------- | ------------- |
| ------------- | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| ------------- | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

## Reporting for Part Bonus 

(Delete if you aren't doing the bonus.)
